# android-wireless-project

This is a MUICT wireless class project. The project requires us to develop an android application using `Kotlin`. Our group chose to do a simple **Crowdsourcing** app where there are 2 types of users; the *artist* and the *supporter*.

SUJA
</h2>

**SUJA** is the name of our application. It comes from Thai words meaning "fighting!" or "good luck". The artist can post and receives donation from the supporter as well as donate to the other artist. The supporter can see the artist's posts and donate to the artist. 

**SUJA** uses Firebase to store data and user's information. The services we use include *[Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)*, *[Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)*, and *[Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage)*. Other notable libraries we use include *[Picasso](https://square.github.io/picasso/)* and *[Android-Image-Cropper](https://github.com/ArthurHub/Android-Image-Cropper)*.
